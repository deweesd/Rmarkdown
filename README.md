Output from various datasets analyzed in R & Rmarkdown from bioinformatic courses
Two courses which gives an introduction to advanced methods in modern statistics, with an emphasis on applied biological data analysis. Material covers modern statistical techniques important for dealing with large, noisy datasets of many variables, including regularization, dimensionality reduction, and deconvolution. Mostly work in the Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework, using Stan as interfaced through R. Upon completeness of this course, will be able to invent, implement, and apply probabilistic models that describe the signal and noise inherent in real datasets.
